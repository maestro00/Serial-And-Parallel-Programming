In mathematics, the Leibniz formula for Ï€, named after Gottfried Leibniz , states that

1 - (1/3) + (1/5) - (1/7) + (1/9) -... =pi/4

It is also called Madhava-Leibniz series as it is a special case of a general expansion of the inverse tangent function, first discovered by the Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama in the 14th century.
